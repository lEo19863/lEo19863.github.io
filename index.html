                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>In Singapore, there are over 60 different bubble tea brands; each with their own unqiue taste and texture of perals.
                    Ever since it arrived from Taiwan, where boba teas originated, it has become a Singapore favorite and the popularity is still increasing today!
                </p>
                <p>Hi, I'm the creator of this website and a boba fan. I thought it would be a fun and exciting prject to create a website introducing my favourite 
                    boba shops and the drinks I really love from each shop. The reason why I love pearl drinks is because they are sweet, has a lot of texture, cold and cheap!
                    It is a local drink in Singapore so I can enjoy different tastes wherever I go. All of the shops have their own creative combinations and it is impossible to get tired of them. 
                </p>
                <h4>Enjoy looking for a boba shop that fits your taste!</p>

                <h2>Tapioca</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Tapioca is a sarch extracted from the cassava plant. It is native to the north and central-west regions of Brazil.
                    This starch plant is a staple food for millions of people in tropical countries, because it provides carbohydrate 
                    and is low in protein, vitamins and minerals. 
                    Recently, tapioca is used for tapioca balls, commonly referred to as boba or pearls when in bubble tea.
                    They are edible translucent spheres, originated as a cheaper alternative to pearl sago in Southeast Asian cuisine. 
                    Often, we see pearls as black balls but by changing different ingredients, like sugar and seasoning, the pearls gain different 
                    color and texture. 
                    Tapioca are also used in jello and other Southeast Asian desserts.

                        <p>My recommended drink is the Milk Tea with Golden Bubbles.</p>
                        <p>At sugar level 50%.</p>
                        <p>Golden bubbles are made from tapioca and it is a special bubble served at Koi the. 
                        Unlike normal boba, it has a unique golden, transparent glow and a very chewy texture. 
                        They are quite small and easy to swallow. </p>
                        <p>The milk tea is a mix of Chinese tea and milk. it doesn't have a strong accent, but it is flavourful and bittersweet. 
                        It creates a harmony when it is topped off with golden bubbles because it adds more sweetness and texture. </p>

                <p>HEYTEA originated in 2012, at Guandong, China. It all started with a unique inspirational idea of making a cheese tea. 
                    Through its success of making the first, original Cheezo tea, HEYTEAs' outlet spread through Asia like wildfire.

                        <h3>My Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>My favorite boba drink from this shop is the Milk Tea Bobashake.</p>
                        <p>At HEYTEA, some drinks are customizable, especially with ice cream. 
                            But I prefer it without customizing it too much because every single drink is carefully thought out and 
                            each one has an interesting twist other shops don't have.</p>
                        <p>The Milk Tea Bobashake is a milk tea with soft pearls coated with melted brown sugar.
                            The fragrant chinese tea goes super well with the sweetness and roastiness of the pearls which are easy to chew.
                            In addtion, unlike normal drinks with ice cubes, this bobashake has a creamy tea shake on top. It cools you down 
                            and adds texture in your drink! The ice in the shake is delicate, so there are no chunks in them.</p>

                        <p>From this bubble tea shop, I recommend the Buble Milk Tea, 国王珍珠奶茶. It is a combination of black tea, cream and bubble.
                            As expected, the black tea has a fragrant and roasty taste. The milk blends in well with tea, enhancing taste
                            of the freshly brewed black tea with a sense of creaminess to it.
                            The pearls from this shops is soft and chewy, reminding me of mochi. (A Japanese rice cake.) The pearls are also not very sticky,
                            so they are easy to swallow and doesn't stick to your throat. I believe that San Chen's pearls are the softest!

                        <h3>My Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>My recommendation from LiHO is the Earl Grey Milk Tea with Brown Sugar Pearls. 
                            Even though it is a milk tea,the distinctive taste of the earl grey remains. There is a good balace between the creaminess
                            of the milk and fragrant taste of the tea. Furtheremore, the brown sugar pearls adds sweetness and toffee-like taste, creating 
                            the milk tea to become more rich and perfect for sweet lovers, like myself. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The pearls at LiHO are chewy and sweet. However, some people may find that the perals are more rubberly than chewy. 
                            So, people who prefer harder pearls or like to bite a lot, please try it out!
