                    <h3>My Recommendation</h3>
                    <p>My recommended drink is the milk tea with golden bubbles.</p>
                    <p>At sugar level 50%.</p>
                    <p>Golden bubbles are made from tapioca and it is a special bubble served at Koi the. 
                     Unlike normal boba, it has a unique golden, transparent glow and a very chewy texture. 
                    They are quite small and easy to swallow. </p>
                    <p>The milk tea is a mix of Chinese tea and milk. it doesn't have a strong accent, but it is flavourful and bittersweet. 
                    It creates a harmony when it is topped off with golden bubbles because it adds more sweetness and texture. </p>

            <p>HEYTEA originated in 2012, at Guandong, China. It all started with a unique inspirational idea of making a cheese tea. 
                Through its success of making the first, original Cheezo tea, HEYTEAs' outlet spread through Asia like wildfire. 
                Their teas are one of the best with tons of creative drinks!

                    <h3>My Recommendation</h3>
                    <p>My favorite boba drink from this shop is the Milk Tea Bobashake.</p>
                    <p>At HEYTEA, some drinks are customizable, especially with ice cream. 
                        But I prefer it without customizing it too much because every single drink is carefully thought out and 
                        each one has an interesting twist other shops don't have.</p>
                    <p>The Milk Tea Bobashake is a milk tea with soft pearls coated with melted brown sugar.
                        The fragrant chinese tea goes super well with the sweetness and roastiness of the pearls which are easy to chew.
                        In addtion, unlike normal drinks with ice cubes, this bobashake has a creamy tea shake on top. It cools you down 
                        and adds texture in your drink! The ice in the shake is delicate, so there are no chunks in them.</p>
